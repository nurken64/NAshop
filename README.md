Project Proposal: Food Store

Students names: K.Nurken, K.Adal, K.Eldos
Group: CS-2303
Group name: Qwerty
Topic: Food Store
Introduction and Relevance

The growing trend of online shopping and the increasing popularity of culinary creativity make a compelling case for a unified platform that combines e-commerce with recipe sharing. This project aims to create a web application that streamlines grocery shopping and integrates a social component through a recipe-sharing platform. 
	
The topic was chosen to address the gaps in the Kazakhstani market where existing e-commerce platforms focus primarily on delivery without fostering user engagement. The application seeks to enhance convenience for users while promoting culinary exploration, aligning with global trends and local cultural preferences.
Competitor Analysis

Kazakhstan's market includes several notable platforms, such as Foodstore.kz, Arbuz.kz, and Korzinavdom.kz. While these platforms provide efficient services, they lack features that differentiate our application.

1. Foodstore.kz:
   - Strengths: Reliable delivery of groceries and household essentials.
   - Weaknesses: Limited focus on user engagement and no additional functionalities like recipe sharing or personalized recommendations.
   - Our Advantage: A comprehensive recipe-sharing platform that encourages user-generated content, coupled with grocery integration.

2. Arbuz.kz:
   - Strengths: Wide selection of products, express delivery, and trusted reputation.
   - Weaknesses: Absence of interactive features or content that engages users beyond the transactional level.
   - Our Advantage: By offering video tutorials, AI-based personalized suggestions, and a gamified experience, our app stands out as both functional and engaging.

3. Korzinavdom.kz:
   - Strengths: Efficient grocery delivery and easy-to-use interface.
   - Weaknesses: Lack of additional user-focused services such as culinary or educational content.
   - Our Advantage: Our focus on building a community around recipes and culinary education creates a unique niche in the market.

Project Features

The proposed application includes several innovative features designed to make it user-centric and engaging:

1. Integrated Grocery Shopping:
   - Categorized product browsing with easy-to-use filters.
   - A smooth checkout process with saved preferences for recurring orders.

   - User-generated content where people can upload, share, and save recipes.
   - The ability to link ingredients directly to the shopping list.

3. Video Tutorials:
   - Short, engaging cooking tutorials linked to recipes, making the learning process interactive and accessible.

4. AI-Powered Personalization:

7. Gamification:

Conclusion

This project combines the functionality of a grocery delivery service with the engagement of a recipe-sharing platform, creating a unique product in the Kazakh market. By focusing on user experience and community engagement, our web app aims to attract a diverse audience, from busy professionals to culinary enthusiasts.
